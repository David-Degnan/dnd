#### Session 1

[[Goldridge]] was riding a clidesdale and revealed his academic background.
[[Fin]] rode a toad and shared nothing.
[[Carrine]] drove the cart and spoke of how he left the woods .
[[Blizzard]] rode a polar bear and shared the sad story of how her parents died. 

The party was attacked by and defeated all 4 goblins and the horse ran out into the woods. The party split with [[Goldridge]] and [[Blizzard]] chasing the cart, and [[Fin]] and [[Carrine]] looting the dead horses and goblin bodies left behind from the goblin ambush. Humdrum the goblin barely held on to life, but was viciously murdered twice by [[Fin]] and [[Carrine]]. [[Fin]] discovers this goblin belongs to the [[Cragmaw tribe]]. 

[[Goldridge]] and [[Blizzard]] were both captured in traps and escaped.

The next morning, the party investigated the scene of the ambush to realize that [[Sildar]] and [[Gundren]] were likely kidnapped. They followed the trail to the Cragmaw Hideout, where they observed their runaway horse being lead away by the goblins into the cave.

The party kidnaps a goblin name [[Iglur]]. They tease [[Iglur]] for information and decided to distract the goblins with the same approach to sneak into the cave. [[Fin]]'s mammaries are painted green and she emerges from the woods, head held high. 

#### Session 2 

The party killed most of the goblins at the entrance, but one with a dagger in its head escaped inside. Whilst traveling in the shallow creek, the party was assaulted by a wave but managed to buckle down and survive it. The source of the great wave is not known. They encountered the goblin den and took out 6 goblins, included the 2nd in command to the Cragmaw hideout, [[Yeemik]]. Unfortunately, the party discovered the remains of the horse. They also discovered [[Sildar]] who shared that the Cragmaws were paid by the [[Black Spider]] to kidnap [[Gundren]] and still his map to the [[Wave Echo Cave]]. We also learned that [[Sildar]]'s contact [[Iarno]] has gone missing in Phandelver. [[Yeemik]], who is the smartest of all goblins and second in command of the Cragmaws, wished for the demise of [[Klarg]] so that he can become leader of the [[Cragmaw tribe]]. The party, along with [[Sildar]] and [[Yeemik]] have decided to eliminate [[Klarg]].
